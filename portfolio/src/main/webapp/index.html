        <p>Hi and welcome to my porfolio. I am a software engineer stuck in an artist's bodyðŸ˜Š.</p>
        <p>I am a sophomore, Computer Science major at Howard University. I am interested in Software Development, Finance Technology and Poetry. I am from Nigeria and speak English and Igbo fluently. Fun fact: In Nigeria over 500 languages are spoken! </p>
        <p>I am currently interested in Human Computer Interactions and inovating technological solutions in the finance industry. I love animes and am a self proclaimed comedian. I also love writing (poetry) and trying out new meal recipes.</p>

        <p>Projects I've worked on:</p>
            <p>Connect 4:
                I made a GUI game version of the connect 4 game. This is a user interactive two player game, which was biult with python and pygame.
                <a href="images/Connect4.mp4">You can watch the game demo here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>MYT:
                Designed and created a social web application which helped students at Howard University find and interact with other students on campus who had similar interest with them. 
            </p>
        <p>Finance:
            Analyzed and created a strategic solution model for P&G after carrying out industry and company research. I and my team proposed a strategic business solution and advised on how the market will react to our proposed plan.
        </p>
        <p>Software Engineering:
            Over the 2020 summer months I was able to intern at Uber as a Software Engineer. During the three months at Uber, I worked on a project which helped identify, prevent and dissallow users who carried out nefarious activity on the Uber platform in Brazil. This project helped promote safety for both Uber riders and drivers in Brazil.
        </p>
        <p>Research:
            I carry out research in Human Computer interactions. My current research is working to identify and prevent racial and gender microaggressions in social media.
